 2) About Previous
 -----------------

Previous is a NeXT Computer emulator based on the Atari emulator Hatari. It uses 
the latest m68k emulation core from WinUAE and the i860 emulator from Jason 
Eckhardt. Previous works on all Systems which are supported by the SDL2 library.

Previous emulates the following machines:
  NeXT Computer (original 68030 Cube)
  NeXTcube
  NeXTcube Turbo
  NeXTstation
  NeXTstation Turbo
  NeXTstation Color
  NeXTstation Turbo Color
  NeXTdimension Graphics Board

Less common machines can be emulated using custom options:
  NeXTstation with up to 128 MB RAM (serial number ABB 002 8000 or later): 
     Select NeXTstation Turbo and set CPU clock to 25 MHz
  NeXTcube, NeXTstation or NeXTstation Color with board revision 1:
     Select one of the above machines and set RTC chip to MCCS1850

Note that some hardware is only supported by later operating system versions.
Listed below are the system and ROM versions that introduced support for new
hardware:

  NeXTstep 0.8: NeXT Computer
           2.0: NeXTcube, NeXTstation
           2.1: NeXTstation Color, NeXTdimension
           2.2: NeXTcube Turbo, NeXTstation Turbo, NeXTstation Turbo Color

  ROM Rev. 0.8: NeXT Computer
           2.0: NeXTcube, NeXTstation, NeXTdimension
           2.4: NeXTstation Color
           3.0: NeXTcube Turbo, NeXTstation Turbo, NeXTstation Turbo Color

Previous includes an internal NFS and NetInfo server for advanced interaction 
with the host system. It also includes an internal time server that makes it 
possible to automatically synchronise host and guest system time. Please note 
that only NeXTstep 2.0 and later support automatic time synchronisation.

Previous comes with a command line utility called "ditool" (disk image tool). It
can be used to extract raw disk image files into a directory on the host system. 
You can get further informations about ditool's features and how to use it by 
calling it with the -h option (ditool -h). Be careful using the -clean option, 
because it will delete all files from the specified directory without asking.

Previous is able to netboot from a directory containing an extracted bootable 
installation of NeXTstep. The netboot feature requires a case sensitive file 
system and extended file attributes (sys/xattr.h) being available on the host 
system.


 3) Compiling and installing
 ---------------------------

For using Previous, you need to have installed the following libraries:

Required:
  > The SDL2 library v2.26.0 or later (http://www.libsdl.org)
  > The zlib compression library (http://www.gzip.org/zlib/)

Optional:
  > The libpng PNG reference library (http://www.libpng.org)
    This is required for printing to files.
  > The pcap library (https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap or 
    https://www.winpcap.org)
    This is required if networking via PCAP is preferred over SLiRP.


Don't forget to also install the header files of these libraries for compiling
Previous (some Linux distributions use separate development packages for these
header files)!

For compiling Previous, you need C and C++ compilers and a working CMake (v3.3 
or later) installation (see http://www.cmake.org/ for details).

CMake can generate makefiles for various flavors of "Make" (like GNU-Make) and 
various IDEs like Xcode on macOS. To run CMake, you have to pass the path to the 
sources of Previous as parameter. For example, run the following command 
sequence to configure the build of Previous in a separate build directory 
(assuming that the current working directory is the top of the source tree):

	mkdir -p build
	cd build
	cmake ..

Have a look at the manual of CMake for other options. Alternatively, you can use 
the "cmake-gui" program to configure the sources with a graphical application or 
"ccmake" to configure them with ncurses UI.

Once CMake has successfully configured the build settings, you can compile 
Previous with:

	cmake --build .

If all works fine, you should get the executable "Previous" in the src/ sub-
directory of the build tree. 

Some systems do not support rendering from secondary threads. In case you get a 
black window try compiling with rendering threads disabled. In the instructions 
above replace "cmake .." with "../configure --disable-rendering-thread".

For more detailed building instructions read the file building.previous.txt.


 4) Status
 ---------

Previous is stable, but some parts are still work in progress. Some hardware is 
not yet emulated. Status of the individual components is as follows:
  CPU             good (but not cycle-exact)
  MMU             good
  FPU             good
  DSP             good
  DMA             good
  NextBus         good
  Memory          good
  2-bit graphics  good
  Color graphics  good
  RTC             good
  Timers          good
  SCSI drive      good
  MO drive        good
  Floppy drive    good
  Ethernet        good
  Serial          partial
  Printer         good
  Sound           good
  Keyboard        good
  Mouse           good
  ADB             dummy
  Nitro           dummy
  Dimension       partial (no video I/O)


There are remaining problems with the host to emulated machine interface for 
input devices.


 5) Known issues
 ---------------

Issues in Previous:
  > Un-emulated hardware may cause problems when attempted to being used.
  > NeXTdimension emulation does not work on hosts with big endian byte order.
  > Shortcuts do not work properly or overlap with host commands on some 
    platforms.
  > CPU timings are not correct. You may experience performance differences 
    compared to real hardware.
  > 68882 transcendental FPU instructions produce results identical to 68040 
    FPSP. The results are slightly different from real 68882 results.
  > Diagnostic tests for Ethernet fail. Diagnostic tests for SCSI Disk and 
    Monitor/Sound fail in certain situations due to timing issues. Disable 
    variable speed mode to reliably pass SCSI Disk diagnostics. Disable sound to 
    pass Monitor/Sound diagnostics.

Issues in NeXTstep:
  > The MO drive causes slow downs and hangs when both drives are connected, but 
    only one disk is inserted. This is confirmed to be a bug in NeXTstep.
  > ROM Monitor, boot log and boot animations won't show on NeXTdimension 
    monitor, if NeXTdimension main memory exceeds 32 MB. This is confirmed to be 
    a bug in the NeXT ROM.
  > Trying to netboot a non-Turbo 68040 machine while no Ethernet cable is 
    connected causes a hang. "ben" stops the system immediately while "btp" 
    shows one dot before it stops. This is the exact same behavior as seen on 
    real hardware. This is confirmed to be a bug in the NeXT ROM.

 7) Running Previous
 -------------------

For running the emulator, you need an image of the boot ROM of the emulated 
machine.

While the emulator is running, you can open the configuration menu by pressing 
F12, toggle between fullscreen and windowed mode by pressing F11 and initiate a 
clean shut down by pressing F10 (emulates the power button).

Further shortcuts can be invoked by simultaneously pressing ctrl and alt and
one of the following keys:

O: Shows main menu (same as F12).
P: Pauses emulation and resumes it when pressed again.
C: Initiates a cold reset. All unsaved changes will be lost.
M: Locks the mouse cursor to the window and releases it when pressed again.
N: Switches between screens if multiple screens are used in single window or 
   fullscreen mode.
G: Grabs the screen contents and saves them to a PNG file. The file is saved 
   inside the directory specified for printer output.
R: Records all sound output to an AIFF file and stops recording when pressed 
   again. The file is saved inside the directory specified for printer output.
F: Toggles between fullscreen and windowed mode (same as F11).
B: Hides the statusbar and shows it when pressed again.
S: Disables sound output and re-enables it when pressed again.
Q: Requests to quit Previous. All unsaved changes will be lost.
